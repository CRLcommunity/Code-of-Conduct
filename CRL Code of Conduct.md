## Section 2. Clean Driving
In this section the rules for clean driving will be mentioned.

### Article 2.1 Official Fia rules
1. Basically, the official rules of the FIA apply as clean driving.
2. Rules in the Code of Conduct are often intended to provide game-specific elements.
3. All Rules mentioned in CRL's Code of Conduct supersede the FIA rules or are intended to supplement or clarify.

### Article 2.2 Clean Driver Role
1. Drivers will be pre-screened in informal race lobbies.
2. As a 'Clean Driver' you will try to be considerate of others according to the rules mentioned in section 3.
3. Incidents can take place on the track. If it is clear that an unfair advantage arises, one should try to solve it in a safe way during the race.
4. Drivers can only join events if their role is set to ‘Clean Driver’.
5. Drivers can only compete in time trial events if their role is set to ‘Clean Driver’.
6. Drivers can lose their 'Clean Driver' role if they don't drive according to the rules.

### Article 2.3 Incident Report
1. If an incident occurs that you think is unfair or controversial, you can report it.
2. Een report moet ingediend worden volgens format in het kanaal #race-incidents.
3. Stewards may expect images to be supplied in sufficient quality. All images/recordings should be as close to source quality as possible.
4. Incidents must be submitted within 48 hours of their occurrence.
5. If the requirements are met, stewards will review and handle the report.

### Article 2.4 Defend incident
1.  If there has been an accident that you think someone is claiming was your fault, but you don't think it is, you should record your side in defense too. The more corners the stewards have, the higher the chance for a correct outcome
2. If images are requested by the stewards from a driver, the driver is obliged to provide them. An exception applies if these images are not available.
3. If requested images cannot be provided, the driver will be asked to share his vision.
4. A driver must meet the question posed in this article within 48 hours.

### Article 2.5 Return to track
1. Reset to track is in all cases prohibited and will result in DSQ from the session.
2. If a driver resetted to track in casual lobbies, their will get noted. If it happens more often they will lose the 'Clean Driver' role.
3. If you leave the track (all 4 wheels off track) or spin on track, it is your responsibility for a safe return to racing. If facing the opposite direction wait, apply the brakes to stop the car rolling, and look for a gap in traffic to spin the car around. If in a dangerous position on track, try to move to a safer position at the earliest opportunity that is safe for other drivers.
4. If returning to the track, also wait for a gap in the traffic or an opportunity to join the track from the racing line at a sensible speed.
5. If you are a driver on track coming across a driver attempting to rejoin at a comparable speed, try to
give them space for the rejoin if it is safe to do so. 
6. All return to track incidents will be considered as if ghosting is not in action, even if it is. Punishments will be given out to incidents that are considered irresponsible returns to racing, especially ones that impact other drivers.

### Article 2.6 AI driving
1. Using AI to enjoy a fast start is prohibited.
2. If you need to retire from the race, please make sure there are no cars following you and remain at normal speed, press start and retire. The AI will find a safe space to pull off the circuit.
3. You are still liable for incidents your AI causes and stewards will judge them as if you are in control.

## Section 3. Rules of Engagement

### Article 3.1 Significant car length alongside
1. As a guide should be considered when the front wheels of the attacker are level with the cockpit of the defending car at corner entry. The further forward is of course more concrete and clearer.
2. Back wheel (defender) to front wheel (attacker) is not a significant car length alongside.
3. This rule will be considered/measured on a case-by-case basis by stewards when incidents occur.

4. It is still advised that defenders leave space to attackers if the red indicator is present for selfpreservation, especially when engaged in none-race critical battles and during the early stages of the race.
5. Closing the door when there is a red indicator is likely to cause incident, which will most likely affect your race and has the potential to stain your track record and character.

### Article 3.2 Attacker / Defender role
1. An attacker or defender role is assigned to drivers when 2 cars (or more) are in racing vicinity to one another. This isn't defined as a set number of seconds but as a general persistent rule.
2. If you can see them in your mirrors or in front of you, you should presume these roles are in place.
3. A car can have both the attacker and defender role at same time to different cars.

4. The defending rule is removed if the attacker is coming to lap you and normal blue flag conditions apply.
5. The attacking role is strongly advised against if the car is a lap behind and trying to un-lap themselves.
6. Moves to un-lap yourself should be cleaner than clean otherwise will be punished strongly.

### Article 3.3 Defending track positions
1. When defending positions, it is important for drivers to make their moves proactively, meaning they are placing their cars where they think is the best position to defend.
2. A proactive move is any move made by the defender before the attacker has chosen or displayed a direction of attack for an overtake.
3. A Reactive move involves changing direction/position once an attacker has made their intentions clear and are not allowed.

### Article 3.4 Defending weaving and re-opening
1. When defending, drivers are allowed to make 1 single change of direction to defend their position and an additional move to re-open up the corner before the breaking zone if the line is clear. Any additional moves will be judged as weaving.
2. When re-opening up the corner they must always leave space for the attacker if any part of their caris alongside you, indicated by a red arrow. This takes precedent over rule 3.1.

### Article 3.5 Defenders space at corner
1. Defenders should aim to leave space for attacking cars at every corner but it is only absolutely required when cars are a significant car length beside you at corner entry.
2. Corner entery is the point at which the driver starts to move their car towards the corner apex
3. This is defined rule in rule 3.1 - 1/2/3. Although it is advised the drivers follow 3.1 - 4/5

### Article 3.6 Defenders responsibility
1. If defenders have followed the rules in 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, then it is now the responsibility of the attacker to overtake safely.
2. If a defender makes a mistake during a corner, for instance going deep on brakes or a twitch on acceleration, it is the responsibility of the attacker to adjust their racing line/speed to avoid incident unless the defending car leaves the track as part of their mistake.

### Article 3.7 Defender with slow pace
1. If the defending car in front has slower pace than the attacker, this does not give the attacker the right to presume the car in front should get out of the way. They have earned their position in front of you through strong racing, strategy or consistency. Show them the respect they deserve.

### Article 3.8 Attackers responsibility
1. At corner entry (the point at which the driver starts to move their car towards the corner apex), the attacker should have a significant part of their car alongside the defender (defined in rule 3.1).
2. If the attacker doesn't have a significant part of their car ahead then any further attempts to take the place during the corner resulting in contact will be deemed the attackers fault.
3. The defending driver only is required to leave space if a significant part of the car is alongside.

4. The attacker should always keep in mind the risks they are taking when participating in an overtaking maneuver vs the reward of pulling it off. Sometimes it is better to wait for a more clearcut overtaking opportunity later in the lap at an easier place to overtake then go for a risky overtake through a technical sector.

### Article 3.9 Giving back a place
1. If you are informed that you need to give a place back due to an on-screen warning, you have to do this in a safe and predictable way.
2. We urge drivers doing so to wait until an open and straight part of the track to peel off the racing line and lift off the throttle (not brake) ensuring there is no car behind. After giving the place up the driver can rejoin the racing line when it’s safe to do so.
3. You may end up having to let multiple cars through to give up the specific position requested.
4. If you feel that you have gained an unfair advantage via an illegal overtake, for example (but not limited to) you ran wide during or after an overtake or gained a position unfairly under yellow flags/safety cars, you may decide to give the place back without the prompt of the on-screen display. You are still required to follow all the guidelines under 3.9.
5. If a car gives a position back on track, this can lessen or nullify a penalty investigation.
6. There are occasions where you may feel a cede position warning is either too dangerous to complete or unwarranted. It may also be the case that the car behind is not willing to overtake. In this case it may be better to take the penalty and serve it at the pit-stops or at the end of the race. If you feel the penalty is unwarranted you can get this reviewed with stewards as a racing incident as under 2.3.
7. Although the on-screen prompt may disappear, you have to give the place fully back (car is no longer side by side) and not attack the car until past the braking zone into another corner.
8. If giving a place back to another driver, it is your responsibility to avoid collisions with other drivers and to do so in a safe manor.

## Section 4. Safety Car Procedure

### Article 4.1 Remain in line
1. Drivers must remain in line during virtual and standard safety car periods. 
2. This is to allow other cars the ability to warm up their tires without the fear that a car will be suddenly in its space. This is the case throughout the entirety of the safety car period, including when preparing to resume the race.
3. Cars can resume going side by side once you have passed the first green flag/light on track and the OSD no longer states “caution” after a safety car restart. If cars go side by side, the source of the infringement will be investigated and acted upon

### Article 4.2 Correct speed
1. Drivers must remain predictable and at the correct speed for the safety car/section of track they are in. Braking sharply or backing other drivers up so your team mate can pit, amongst other reasons, are not allowed and will result in action from the stewards.

### Article 4.3 Follow OSD Display
1. Drivers must follow the OSD display
2. Drivers may ignore the OSD if is is obviously incorrect. The driver than needs to make a recording and let it review after the race by a stewards as a racing incident as under 2.3.
3. Drive-through penalties accrued for not following the delta must be served and cannot be reviewed by the stewards.

### Article 4.4 Overtake under Safety Car
1. Drivers can overtake cars going unduly slowly. This is applied if the car has spun on the track or have left the defined track area (all 4 wheels over the white lines).
2. This also applies to cars that have caught up with the pack and have fallen more than 10 car lengths behind.
3. Drivers cannot unlap themselves, the game doesn't allow it. If you are a lap down, then you are probably out of contention for the race win so just focus on your race from there.
4. Drivers can overtake cars entering the pits once they have crossed the white line signaling pit entry. Drivers can also overtake cars leaving the pits until the end of the white line. Once the car leaving the pit has crossed beyond the end of the white line, drivers must stay behind if they don't have any of their car in front.
5. If you have damage and wish to let other cars past, you must leave the track with 4 wheels to do so. Going unduly slowly on the racing track on purpose will draw a dim view from the stewards and could result in a penalty. If you have damage, it is accepted that you will be slower and other drivers must accommodate for that.
6. If you have accidentally took a place by mistake that was unjust/incorrect without receiving an on-screen warning to give the place back, the stewards are offering the opportunity for cars to give the places back after the safety car restart. This should only be done after green flag racing has resumed, to avoid penalty warnings for other drivers, and should be completed if possible before the end of the first sector.
7. If you are found to have overtaken under safety car without good reason and not given the place back or only given the place back under duress, you will be penalized if a race-incident had been reported or seen by stewards.

### Article 4.4 Restart from Safety Car
1. As lead driver, it is your responsibility to resume racing in a safe manor for the whole field.
2. The restart should consist of one clear return to racing.
3. Any ambiguity around speeding up and slowing down will be penalized.
4. Drivers should wait for the safety car to be at pit-entry/'prepare to resume racing' message to show before any acceleration to resume racing, to avoid being slowed down by the game. If the game does slow you down, you are still accountable for your actions for not correctly following the game’s instructions.

## Section 5. Blue Flag Procedure

### Article 5.1 Blue flag shown
1. If drivers that are more than a lap up on you are approaching you from behind, the game will show a blue flag UI message and flag light panels will start to flash blue on track.
2. Once you receive the message/see the lights you will be counted as a 'blue flagged car' and you in total 6 blue flag lights to show that you are letting the lapping driver through.
3. Blue flagged cars are advised to get out of the way at the next available opportunity, preferably on a straight and always off the racing line following the rules in article 3.9.
4. Blue flagged cars do not have to jump out of the way as soon as they see the messages but instead when it best suits both cars, within the 6 flag limit.
5. Blue flagged cars are advised to cede positions to all other cars that are approaching you from behind that are a lap up, but this isn't a requirement. As soon as you let one car by the 6 light warning resets, and you have another 6 lights to let the next lapping car through.
6. When ceding positions as a blue flagged car it is important to be clear and predictable to other drivers. It is not required that you leave the track to let lapped runners through but if you do leave the track, you must rejoin it in a safe way so others are not impeded by your rejoin, as per normal racing conditions.
7. Some digression will be given to the 6 flag warning limit depending on the track configuration and space available. This digression will only be given if it is clear to stewards that the blue flagged car is trying everything in its power to let the lapping car through at the earliest point possible.

### Article 5.2 Coming up to blue flagged traffic
1. As a car coming up to blue flagged traffic, it is important to remember that the cars ahead don't have to jump out of the way as soon as they see your car. They are running their own race.
2. During some sectors/circuits it is difficult to find space to come off the racing line and slow, so think about when you first got the message/how long it takes them to get out of your way before reporting it to the stewards.
3. As a car approaching blue flag traffic, be mindful that they will try to peel off of the racing line and slow down, so leave them a bit of breathing room for them to do their thing. Forcing an overtake that is unsafe on a blue flagged car will be deemed as an incident like any other under the rules of engagement section.

### Article 5.3 Un-lapping
1. Tt is advised against un-lapping yourself unless you have a significant pace advantage. Remember, during attempts to un-lap yourself, normal section rules apply as if you were an Attacking driver and moves should be cleaner than clean. Your race ultimately isn't with them.

## Section 6. Red Flag Procedure

### Article 6.1 Red flag shown
1. Red Flags may be used by Race Directors to signify that the session needs to come to a stop and drivers need to retire their cars.
2. If the !redflag command is ushered by a Race Director ) Red Flags may be used by Race Directors to signify that the session needs to come to a stop and
drivers need to retire their cars.
3. If the !redflag command is ushered by a Race Director in the Event channels, then all drivers racing in that event must follow the instructions given and retire their car from the session.

### Article 6.2 Potential reasons to call a red flag (this isn't exhaustive):
1. 
a) There has been a jump start in conjunction with the ready up rule and the session needs to be reset following the rules laid out in section 5.
b) There is a serious issue with the lobby that has affected the integrity of the race and all drivers meaning it is no longer feasible to complete the race in this session.
c) The lobby has not been setup correctly meaning the rules have not been correctly set, to the point that the integrity of the race is compromised.
d) There is no longer enough drivers left in the session to complete a race.

2. If you feel there is valid reason to call for a red flag that has been unnoticed by race direction please alert us via the event-chat channel tagging the divisions race-director. The reason must be something that at least affects the majority of the drivers and not a crash or glitch that affects you and maybe another single driver.

## Section 7. TBA
Formationlap process, Attendance during events, Spirit of competition for events, Penalty Point license system, 
For now the rules in section 7 are not specified. The steward will tell live what the rules are. Updated Code of Conduct wil be fast in place.
