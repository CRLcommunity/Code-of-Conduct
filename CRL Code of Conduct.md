## Section 2. Clean Driving
In this section the rules for clean driving will be mentioned.

### Article 2.1 Official Fia rules
1. Basically, the official rules of the FIA apply as clean driving.
2. Rules in the Code of Conduct are often intended to provide game-specific elements.
3. All Rules mentioned in CRL's Code of Conduct supersede the FIA rules or are intended to supplement or clarify.

### Article 2.2 Clean Driver Role
1. Drivers will be pre-screened in informal race lobbies.
2. As a 'Clean Driver' you will try to be considerate of others according to the rules mentioned in section 3.
3. Incidents can take place on the track. If it is clear that an unfair advantage arises, one should try to solve it in a safe way during the race.
4. Drivers can only join events if their role is set to ‘Clean Driver’.
5. Drivers can only compete in time trial events if their role is set to ‘Clean Driver’.
6. Drivers can lose their 'Clean Driver' role if they don't drive according to the rules.

### Article 2.3 Incident Report
1. If an incident occurs that you think is unfair or controversial, you can report it.
2. Een report moet ingediend worden volgens format in het kanaal #race-incidents.
3. Stewards may expect images to be supplied in sufficient quality. All images/recordings should be as close to source quality as possible.
4. Incidents must be submitted within 48 hours of their occurrence.
5. If the requirements are met, stewards will review and handle the report.

### Article 2.4 Defend incident
1.  If there has been an accident that you think someone is claiming was your fault, but you don't think it is, you should record your side in defense too. The more corners the stewards have, the higher the chance for a correct outcome
2. If images are requested by the stewards from a driver, the driver is obliged to provide them. An exception applies if these images are not available.
3. If requested images cannot be provided, the driver will be asked to share his vision.
4. A driver must meet the question posed in this article within 48 hours.

### Article 2.5 Return to track
1. Reset to track is in all cases prohibited and will result in DSQ from the session.
2. If a driver resetted to track in casual lobbies, their will get noted. If it happens more often they will lose the 'Clean Driver' role.
3. If you leave the track (all 4 wheels off track) or spin on track, it is your responsibility for a safe return to racing. If facing the opposite direction wait, apply the brakes to stop the car rolling, and look for a gap in traffic to spin the car around. If in a dangerous position on track, try to move to a safer position at the earliest opportunity that is safe for other drivers.
4. If returning to the track, also wait for a gap in the traffic or an opportunity to join the track from the racing line at a sensible speed.
5. If you are a driver on track coming across a driver attempting to rejoin at a comparable speed, try to
give them space for the rejoin if it is safe to do so. 
6. All return to track incidents will be considered as if ghosting is not in action, even if it is. Punishments will be given out to incidents that are considered irresponsible returns to racing, especially ones that impact other drivers.

### Article 2.6 AI driving
1. Using AI to enjoy a fast start is prohibited.
2. If you need to retire from the race, please make sure there are no cars following you and remain at normal speed, press start and retire. The AI will find a safe space to pull off the circuit.
3. You are still liable for incidents your AI causes and stewards will judge them as if you are in control.

## Section 3. Rules of Engagement

### Article 3.1 Significant car length alongside
1. As a guide should be considered when the front wheels of the attacker are level with the cockpit of the defending car at corner entry. The further forward is of course more concrete and clearer.
2. Back wheel (defender) to front wheel (attacker) is not a significant car length alongside.
3. This rule will be considered/measured on a case-by-case basis by stewards when incidents occur.

4. It is still advised that defenders leave space to attackers if the red indicator is present for selfpreservation, especially when engaged in none-race critical battles and during the early stages of the race.
5. Closing the door when there is a red indicator is likely to cause incident, which will most likely affect your race and has the potential to stain your track record and character.

### Article 3.2 Attacker / Defender role
1. An attacker or defender role is assigned to drivers when 2 cars (or more) are in racing vicinity to one another. This isn't defined as a set number of seconds but as a general persistent rule.
2. If you can see them in your mirrors or in front of you, you should presume these roles are in place.
3. A car can have both the attacker and defender role at same time to different cars.

4. The defending rule is removed if the attacker is coming to lap you and normal blue flag conditions apply.
5. The attacking role is strongly advised against if the car is a lap behind and trying to un-lap themselves.
6. Moves to un-lap yourself should be cleaner than clean otherwise will be punished strongly.

### Article 3.3 Defending track positions
1. When defending positions, it is important for drivers to make their moves proactively, meaning they are placing their cars where they think is the best position to defend.
2. A proactive move is any move made by the defender before the attacker has chosen or displayed a direction of attack for an overtake.
3. A Reactive move involves changing direction/position once an attacker has made their intentions clear and are not allowed.

### Article 3.4 Defending weaving and re-opening
1. When defending, drivers are allowed to make 1 single change of direction to defend their position and an additional move to re-open up the corner before the breaking zone if the line is clear. Any additional moves will be judged as weaving.
2. When re-opening up the corner they must always leave space for the attacker if any part of their caris alongside you, indicated by a red arrow. This takes precedent over rule 3.1.

### Article 3.5 Defenders space at corner
1. Defenders should aim to leave space for attacking cars at every corner but it is only absolutely required when cars are a significant car length beside you at corner entry.
2. Corner entery is the point at which the driver starts to move their car towards the corner apex
3. This is defined rule in rule 3.1 - 1/2/3. Although it is advised the drivers follow 3.1 - 4/5

### Article 3.6 Defenders responsibility
1. If defenders have followed the rules in 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5, then it is now the responsibility of the attacker to overtake safely.
2. If a defender makes a mistake during a corner, for instance going deep on brakes or a twitch on acceleration, it is the responsibility of the attacker to adjust their racing line/speed to avoid incident unless the defending car leaves the track as part of their mistake.

### Article 3.7 Defender with slow pace
1. If the defending car in front has slower pace than the attacker, this does not give the attacker the right to presume the car in front should get out of the way. They have earned their position in front of you through strong racing, strategy or consistency. Show them the respect they deserve.

### Article 3.8 Attackers responsibility
1. At corner entry (the point at which the driver starts to move their car towards the corner apex), the attacker should have a significant part of their car alongside the defender (defined in rule 3.1).
2. If the attacker doesn't have a significant part of their car ahead then any further attempts to take the place during the corner resulting in contact will be deemed the attackers fault.
3. The defending driver only is required to leave space if a significant part of the car is alongside.

4. The attacker should always keep in mind the risks they are taking when participating in an overtaking maneuver vs the reward of pulling it off. Sometimes it is better to wait for a more clearcut overtaking opportunity later in the lap at an easier place to overtake then go for a risky overtake through a technical sector.
